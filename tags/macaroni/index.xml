      <description>MARK-I 25.09 is here! We are excited to share that the first release of MARK-I 25.09 is been released!
The mark-i release is the stable source-based release for Desktop. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that is not perfect but it&amp;rsquo;s an important milestone for us that sign the start point of the MARK era also for Desktop.
This release is been pretty tested over the Phoenix pipeline in the mark-iii but there are few packages not yet available in Phoenix that are not integrated in the build chain that could be have issues, but normally, the core packages are all in the build chain and we can consider the tree pretty stable for end users.</description>

      <description>Funtoo is dead, long live to M.A.R.K.! Is just in the previous post that I wrote about how many communities are in difficult and that is need new lymph from young developers and at the begin of July with a pain in the heart that I received the news shared from Daniel Robbins about the Funtoo shutdown.
These the words shared by him: &amp;ldquo;All Good Things Must Come to an End&amp;rdquo;.</description>

This release proves that we aren&amp;rsquo;t only a distribution that uses Funtoo but also tries to explore new areas for both the Funtoo Community and our users. We want to help the Opensource world to increase its popularity and its features or at least try. This is a hard mission, that requires time, but we believe in this and we will always combat this.</description>

      <description>We are happy to announce that after three intense months we have finally completed the migration of Macaroni Phoenix to a Funtoo Next based system.
This is a really good milestone for us because after two years we have been a big step ahead, before becoming an independent project, entering in the Docker Sponsored program, and now with the first big release upgrade. The world is buggy so we are sure that something will be also present in this first big step but we hope the community and the users will be happy about how things grow.</description>

      <description>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s available the new macaroni-security repository!
Considering that the Funtoo release 1.4-prime is in EOL, we will use the macaroni-security repository to share security patches and updates of Browsers, Devs tools, and other packages meantime we rebooting Phoenix&amp;rsquo;s branch to Funtoo Next.
Due to this change, all users using Macaroni Phoenix MUST add the macaroni-security repository before executing any update.
$&amp;gt; luet repo update $&amp;gt; luet i repository/macaroni-security $&amp;gt; luet repo update $&amp;gt; luet upgrade The repository macaroni-security uses the new tree v2 which requires luet version 0.</description>

      <description>We have important news to share: the development of our PMS continues and finally, we have rewritten the method used to bump a new revision of the repository.
This enhancement integrates a new way to create the tree tarball used on repo update command. This new implementation breaks the existing implementation. For this reason, we will migrate to the new implementation in August or September. This will permit to users to upgrade to the minimal luet version requires: version 0.</description>

      <description>We are happy to announce the new release Phoenix 23.05 that contains the first significant change needed to migrate the Phoenix tree from the Funtoo release 1.4-prime to the Next release, an activity that will be completed for the subsequent releases. In particular, with this release is dropped the support of Python 2.7 in EOL for a lot of months. The package dev-lang-2.7/python is yet available because a lot of Funtoo packages depend on it for compilation but it&amp;rsquo;s discouraged the use.</description>

      <description>After receiving the first notifications we caught an issue in our last ISOs related to the split of the Grub package done to divide the grub-emu binary. It&amp;rsquo;s been removed for error the Grub&amp;rsquo;s patches related to ext4 1.47.0 and of Macaroni initramfs naming.
Without the patch the default installation fails on setup grub because it&amp;rsquo;s used ext4 and an unknown filesystem error is generated by grub.
The new ISOs will be available in two days.</description>

      <description>While we have worked on preparing the new ISOs for the release 23.03 we have figured out that was better to bump a new release with the changes of the Calamares plugin to migrate our ISOs to kernel 6.1. In particular, the ISOs for Desktops have now the kernel 6.1.18 with built-in integration with new Realtek wifi cards. Unluckily not yet the cards 8852b e 8852be that will be available on branch 6.</description>

      <description>Finally, after two months of hard work, the release Phoenix 23.03 is out and is the first Desktop release under the new macaronios.org domain.
In these two months, we had to follow infrastructure issues (broken hard disks) and create the new Macaroni network. This is one of the reasons we have skipped the release of February.
We want to thank again the GARR consortium that is now our primary mirror under our CDN and this will permit in the next weeks to expose again the ISOs download page and our LXD images.</description>

      <description>After 1 year of incubation under the Funtoo Foundation, the Macaroni OS has now its domain macaronios.org and its infrastructure. Really, thanks to the Funtoo Foundation and Daniel Robbins for its support that helped to Macaroni OS to be here today.
From the infrastructure aspect nothing is changed, all compilation tasks are executed over MottainaiCI cluster but with less resource power for now.
We hope that the community will help us to maintain the infrastructure costs with donations over our Github Sponsor or with VMs donations for compilation.</description>
