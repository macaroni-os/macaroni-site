# Getting Started

# Install Macaroni ISO

Choose the right ISO for your requirements from our [Download](https://www.macaronios.org/iso/) page.

## 1.Validate downloaded ISO

After the you have downloaded the ISOs file, I suggest to verify the quality of the download with
our SHA256 hash:

```shell
$ sha256sum Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso
8637d8c6ba72f8694aabd631f038473acaadd0fbb8fc9fa7cec7bb0d495f1f54  Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso

$ cat  Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso.sha256 
8637d8c6ba72f8694aabd631f038473acaadd0fbb8fc9fa7cec7bb0d495f1f54
```

If the download is correct the hash will be the same.


## 2.Flash your USB drive

To write an ISO there are different tools and ways. My suggestion is to use the wonderful tool
[Balena Etcher](https://etcher.download/) that validates the written bytes before sharing the result.

**NOTE**: At the moment the `ventoy` USB Solution is not supported.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Balena Etcher](../../images/install/etcher2.png)

</div>

## 3.Check your BIOS

At the moment, the Macaroni ISOs don't support an EFI-signed bootstrap.
So, before bootstrapping your USB drive just check and disable EFI security
check.

Hereinafter is an example of how to setup the right options:

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![ASUS T300 Bios](../../images/install/bios1.jpg)

</div>

Normally, based on device there are different ways to enter the BIOS or EUFI setup,
with `F10`, `Canc`, `F2`. You need to check your device manual.

## 4.Boot the ISO


When the Menu is visible could be possible customize boot options with
`E` keyboard button. After push to `E` keyboard button compares in the foot
the default command line options where you can add every kernel options.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![EFI ISO Menu](../../images/install/isomenu-efi.png)

</div>

#### Disable Nouveau driver

By default we prefer using nouveau driver for the NVIDIA cards on bootstrap
our live ISOs. But it's possible that some new cards could be not
yet supported.

To force the loading of the NVIDIA kernel module you can add this
option:

```
modprobe.blacklist=nouveau
```

#### Enter in the ISO bootstrap shell

If there are issues with bootstrap on the Macaroni ISOs you can
enter in the initrd shell in order to recover informations about your
system and help us to check what happens.

To enter in the shell before the probing of the ISO squashfs to debug
the probing phase and the switch root command you need to add `shell=1` as
option.

#### ISOLinux bootstrap

At the moment the options described above are not available in the ISOLinux
menu, visible hereinafter:

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Syslinux Menu](../../images/install/isolinux.png)

</div>

The ISOLinux menu normally is available for non-EFI systems.

## 5. Start Installer

All our ISOs are configured with *Network Manager* by default which is better
integrated with the Calamares installer. You are free to disable and change it
later when the system is installed.

The default user of Macaroni ISO is `macaroni` with password `macaroni`.

#### Server ISO

The Server ISO automatically starts an X server with Calamares without
a Desktop Environment.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Calamares Server](../../images/install/installer-server.png)

</div>

The X server available with the Server ISO is limited. If you don't have
a network with DHCP you can change the `tty` and using `nmtui` to setup
Networking correctly.

#### XFCE ISO

To start the Macaroni Installer click on *Install System* from
*Applications* → *System* → *Install System*.


<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Install System XFCE](../../images/install/xfce-menu-install.png)

</div>

#### Gnome ISO

To start the Macaroni installer you need to enter on Applications dashboard
and search for *install*:

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Install System Gnome](../../images/install/install-gnome.png)

</div>

## 6. Follow Installer workflow

#### 6.1 Welcome: Select Language

In this page if the installer detects correctly at least one hard drive
is present the first choice of the user: the select of the language.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Language](../../images/install/installer-language.png)

</div>

At the moment the tested languages are English and Italianx but other languages are available.
If you find some problem with the other languages open an issue.

#### 6.2 Location: Select Region and Zone

The second page of the installer permits you to configure the Region and the timezone.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Region](../../images/install/installer-region.png)

</div>

Choose the right value from the map and go ahead.

#### 6.3 Keyboard: Select Keyboard Model and Language

The third page of the installer permits you to configure the Keyboard Model and the langauge.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Keyboard](../../images/install/installer-keyboard.png)

</div>


#### 6.4 Partitions: Select storage device and Partitions

In this page you need to select the storage device from the menu and choose how the installer will prepare the partitions.

If the selected disk is empty the installer will propose only two choices: *Erase disk* and *Manual partitioning*.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Partitions](../../images/install/installer-partitions-erase.png)

</div>

If you wish to reinstall Macaroni OS to an existing system and/or replace existing partitions you can select the
option *Replace a partition*:

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Partitions and Replace](../../images/install/installer-replace.png)

</div>

If you are a newbie, my suggestion is to use the self partitioning mode from the Macaroni Installer that automatically
define three main parititions: efi boot (if you are in EFI env), Swap partition and a Root partition for all data.

#### *Encrypt Full Disk*

Macaroni supports Encryption of full system, the only partition left in clear-text is the EFI partition.

To enable the encryption you need to flag *Encrypt system* and write the passphrase as visible in the screenshot hereinafter:

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Partition Encrypted](../../images/install/installer-partitions-encrypt.png)

</div>

With the option *Encrypt System* also the *swap* partition will be encrypted. The passphrase will be asked on GRUB before
printing the Menu.

#### *Manual Partitioning*

An expert user could create their custom installation with different partitions, for example, to divide `/var/` from `/`,
etc.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Partitions Manual](../../images/install/installer-parts-manual.png)

</div>

#### *Encrypt Home Partition Only*

Personally, I think that could be a good compromise to have the rootfs without encryption, this makes things easier
on restoring a broken system and only encrypt the `home` with user data.

This is possible from *Manual Partioning* on creating an encrypted partition.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Partition Home Encrypted](../../images/install/part-home-encrypt.png)

</div>

To enable this it's only needed after selecting the File System type (in the screenshot *ext4*),
to set the *Encrypt* flag and set the passphrase.

**NOTE: On setup, in a configuration with single partitions encrypted you need to do some
manual operations when the installation is completed or at the first boot.
Unfortunately, at the moment the configuration of a single encrypted partition is not
handled correctly and automatically by the Calamares installer. So, these
steps will be described later.**

#### 6.5 Users: Define User and Passwords

It's now time to define the user of your system, write your name and the name of your computer
and choose your password.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Users](../../images/install/installer-users.png)

</div>

Normally, the defined user will be the admin user and the same password will be
used for `root`. If you want a different password for root, you need to disable the
flag related to the option: *Use the same password for the administrator account*.

#### 6.6 Summary: Show configured options

At this point, you are near to starting the installation of your Macaroni OS system.

Just check the selected options before starting the installation.

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Summary](../../images/install/installer-summary.png)

</div>

If all is ok, go ahead with the *Install* button.

#### 6.7 Install: The Installation is started

Finally, the Macaroni Installer begins to write your hard drive. The time needed
depends on your hardware and the speed of the hard drive.

#### 6.8 Finish: The Installation is completed

Wohoo! Your Macaroni system is ready!

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Installer Summary](../../images/install/installer_done.png)

</div>

Set the *Restart now* flag to reboot your computer and to start your Macaroni OS.

#### 6.9 The First boot

#### *Full Encrypted Disk*

If you have chosen to encrypt the full disk on bootstrap then GRUB will
ask for the passphrase inserted in installation phase before displaying
the GRUB menu and going ahead with the bootstrap of your system.

Hereinafter, an example of what that could look like:

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Grub Password](../../images/install/grub-passphrase.png)

</div>

#### *Complete the setup of Home's encrypted partition*

If you have encrypted only the home partition or any other partition with the
workflow described before, you need to execute a few steps to have the
installation working correctly .

a. **Retrieve the LUKS filesystem Id**

```shell
# cat /etc/fstab 
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may
# be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if
# disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system>             <mount point>  <type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
UUID=ABF5-91D0                                        /boot/efi      vfat    defaults,noatime 0 2
UUID=f202c1d1-b131-45f5-8973-8f82cb63d688             /              ext4    defaults,noatime 0 1
/dev/mapper/luks-f1504aa0-2594-4221-b741-7ba315b47de0 /home          ext4    defaults,noatime 0 2
```

In this case the needed value is `f1504aa0-2594-4221-b741-7ba315b47de0`.

b. **Editing the GRUB configuration file `/etc/default/grub` and add this option:**

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.luks.uuid=f1504aa0-2594-4221-b741-7ba315b47de0"
```

Where it's used the LUKS filesystem ID with the option `rd.luks.uuid` that
says to `dracut` to manage the prompt on Plymouth for uncrypt the home partition
before starting X.

c. **Rebuild the *initramfs* image with `macaronictl`**

```shell
$> macaronictl kernel gi --all --grub 
Creating initrd image /boot/initramfs-vanilla-x86_64-6.1.18-macaroni...DONE
Creating grub config file /boot/grub/grub.cfg...
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/kernel-vanilla-x86_64-6.1.18-macaroni

fgrep: warning: fgrep is obsolescent; using /bin/grep -F
  WARNING: Failed to connect to lvmetad. Falling back to device scanning.
done
```

d. **Check dmcrypt service**

Ensure that the `dmcrypt` service is enabled on boot runlevel:

```shell
$> rc-update show
       NetworkManager |      default                           
         avahi-daemon |      default                           
               binfmt | boot                                   
            bluetooth |      default                           
             bootmisc | boot                                   
              cgroups |                                 sysinit
                 dbus | boot                                   
                devfs |                                 sysinit
        device-mapper |                                 sysinit
              dmcrypt | boot                                   
...

```

Enable it if it's not already with:

```shell
$> rc-update add dmcrypt boot
```

e. **Reboot your system.**

If all is been configured correctly on bootstrap you will see the Plymouth page
with the prompt where you insert the passphrase to mount *home* partition:

<div style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">

![Grub Password](../../images/install/dracut-boot-enc-home.png)

</div>


**NOTE: Installing Macaroni OS with Xorg on MacOS Sonoma 14.0 in a Virtual Machine with 
        VMware Fusion 12.2.3 seems to have an issue with the mouse setup. The same issue
        is also present using VMware Workstation 16.
        The problem seems related to the *vmmouse* driver. Forcing using *evdev*
        driver fixes the problem. Hereinafter, is an example of a possible solution:**

```shell
$> mkdir -p /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
$> echo '
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier	"vmmouse"
	MatchIsPointer	"on"
	MatchTag	"vmmouse"
	Driver		"evdev"
EndSection
' > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-vmmouse.conf

$> /etc/init.d/xdm restart

```



# Install Macaroni LXD/Incus Containers

Macaroni OS supplies LXD/Incus images over a Simplestreams Server with help of the
[simplestreams-builder](https://github.com/MottainaiCI/simplestreams-builder) tool.

To configure your LXD system to download Macaroni OS images you need to add the `macaroni` remote:

```shell
$> lxc remote add macaroni https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/images/lxd-images --protocol simplestreams --public
```

Our Simplestreams Server works correctly with both LXD and Incus, so you can add the remote
with `incus` too:

```shell
$> incus remote add macaroni https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/images/lxd-images --protocol simplestreams --public
```

The images are visible with the command:

```shell
$> lxc image list macaroni:
$> # or
$> incus image list macaroni:
```

# Install Macaroni Docker Containers

The official Docker Hub user is [macaronios](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/macaronios).

To play with Macaroni just create your container:

```shell
$> docker run --rm -ti macaronios/terragon-minimal:latest-amd64
```

And then install your packages:

```shell
