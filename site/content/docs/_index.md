# Why Macaroni OS?

Supply a binary distro that follow the Sabayon OS ideas and
permit to convert the rootfs to a pure Funtoo rootfs in a fast way if
it's needed for specific customizations or to help the distro fix issues.

You know, the world is buggy, it's better to have a way to check and
resolve the problems fast.

In the middle of the story, `Macaroni OS` wants to be an optimized
distro for LXD containers, docker and singularity.

So, in summary, these are the core targets of the **Macaroni OS Linux**:
