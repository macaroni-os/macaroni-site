In the last period due to the changes in the new domain and the stabilization of the Macaroni infra there are been a lot of changes in the repository URLs. Working with donated resources and/or free resources has the consequence that the changes could happen.
So, I will describe the better way to upgrade safe our repositories.
a) leave only the geaaru-repo-index repository enabled. This means to call luet repo disable for all others repositories
$# luet repo disable macaroni-commons mottainai-stable macaroni-funtoo $# luet repo list --enabled geaaru-repo-index Macaroni OS Repository Index Revision 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 -00 Priority 1 - Type http b) At this point, it\u0026rsquo;s possible update the repository and get the new urls:
$# luet repo update üè† Repository: geaaru-repo-index Revision: 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 -00 $# luet upgrade The upgrade creates the files /etc/luet/repos.conf.d/._cfg_\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.yml that could be merged with the command etc-update (in the old system) or with the command macaronictl etc-update in the more updated systems.
After the upgrade and the merge of the new configs the system is ready for the updates: luet repo update and luet upgrade.
It\u0026rsquo;s possible check the repositories urls with:
# luet repo list --urls --enabled geaaru-repo-index Geaaru Repository index Revision 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 UTC Priority 1 - Type http Urls: * https://cdn.macaronios.org/mottainai/geaaru-repo-index macaroni-commons-dev Macaroni OS Commons Development Repository Revision 129 - 2023-03-03 22:16:31 +0000 UTC Priority 10 - Type http Urls: * https://dev.macaronios.org/macaroni-commons-dev/ macaroni-funtoo-systemd-dev Macaroni OS Funtoo Eagle Develop Repository Revision 452 - 2023-02-26 11:14:32 +0000 UTC Priority 2 - Type http Urls: * https://images.macaronios.org/macaroni-funtoo-systemd-dev/ mottainai-dev Mottainai Development Repository Revision 72 - 2023-02-25 23:47:52 +0000 UTC Priority 10 - Type http Urls: * https://dev.macaronios.org/mottainai-dev/ mottainai-stable Mottainai official Repository Revision 72 - 2023-02-25 23:47:52 +0000 UTC Priority 30 - Type http Urls: * https://dl.macaronios.org/repos/mottainai/ * https://cdn2.macaronios.org/repos/mottainai/ * https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/repos/mottainai/ 2. What to do after the upgrade of the luet binary? I leave this point in the FAQ because I began to rewrite the Macaroni PMS and until I will rewrite the luet-build binary the luet repo update command executes some post-fetch operations on the downloaded tree to speed up the research, and to have the files used by the new solver available in the luet version 0.33.0 and followed.
So, after the upgrade of luet there are two things that is better to do:
$# luet database reindex This will rebuild the Bolt Database indexes and
$# luet repo update --force that download and executes again the post-fetch hooks in the downloaded tree.
One of the errors reported by the users when is not executed a full fetch of the Macaroni repositories after the upgrade is this:
ü§î Computing upgrade, please hang tight... üí§ Error: Package net-libs-4/webkit not found on map 3. Why luet search doesn\u0026rsquo;t return packages? Excluding the search of the packages installed, i mean with the --installed option, the luet search command works only when the enabled repositories are been synced.
It\u0026rsquo;s just needed to download one time the repositories tree and then all works fine.
$# luet repo update ... $# luet s macaronictl app-admin/macaronictl-0.6.2 app-admin/macaronictl-thin-0.6.2 # luet s portage-converter macaroni/luet-portage-converter-0.11.2 `}),e.add({id:2,href:"/blog/phoenix-23.03.02/",title:"Macaroni OS Phoenix 23.03.02 is out!",section:"Blog",content:`After receiving the first notifications we caught an issue in our last ISOs related to the split of the Grub package done to divide the grub-emu binary. It\u0026rsquo;s been removed for error the Grub\u0026rsquo;s patches related to ext4 1.47.0 and of Macaroni initramfs naming.
Without the patch the default installation fails on setup grub because it\u0026rsquo;s used ext4 and an unknown filesystem error is generated by grub.
The new ISOs will be available in two days.
Unlucky, to build the ISOs with the stable repositories at the moment we need to wait that the stable repositories to be synced to our CDN and main mirror.
We have planned to integrate the repetitors feature to luet that will permit to reduce the outgoing traffic when it\u0026rsquo;s used Macaroni for CD/CI and for us, to test stable repository before sync it to master.
All ISOs will be with ZRAM enabled by default.
Sorry for this issue.
Behind this fix, I fixed the URL reported in the Calamares installer that was yet with the old domain macaroni.funtoo.org.

In particular, the ISOs for Desktops have now the kernel 6.1.18 with built-in integration with new Realtek wifi cards. Unluckily not yet the cards 8852b e 8852be that will be available on branch 6.2. We will try to support it on kernel 6.1 with an external driver in the next release.
The Server ISOs maintain the kernel 5.10 LTS.
This is the reason for this delay and this micro-release.
We share in addition, that testing the Firefox release 109.0.1 that is been released on release 23.01 has figured out that there are some issues with NVIDIA cards. The Firefox windows were stalled often and only disabling hardware acceleration fixed this issue. So, please, if users have some similar experience with release 111.0 open an issue.
The new Download page We are very happy to share finally the new Download page where retrieve the new ISOs is now available. Inside the Download page we have tried to use a labels view that we hope will help users to choose the right ISOs for their requirements. Any feedback about this will help, thanks.
macaronictl gets again power! After receive tons of requests about integrate a switch command to upgrade the kernel release, we are happy to share that the time is arrived\u0026hellip;

Whip power! With little steps, we improve our knife swiss that is used to post-install hooks and for validation. In this release, we have added new important hooks to the whip catalog:
linking.check: This hook permit to validation of existing installation and search for libraries or binary with a broken link. So, if you find some issue with running this in a clean installation, please, open an issue.
For example, on Eagle release I found this issue that permits to be fixed very fast until the fix will be available on the repository:
$\u0026gt; whip h linking.check Checking directory /usr/lib64... Checking directory /usr/lib... Checking directory /usr/bin... /usr/bin/rsync Checking directory /bin... Checking directory /usr/sbin... Checking directory /usr/libexec... [linking.check] Completed correctly. The rsync binary seems broken:
$\u0026gt; ldd /usr/bin/rsync linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcb294f000) libacl.so.1 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libacl.so.1 (0x00007f9571d29000) libpopt.so.0 =\u0026gt; not found libcrypto.so.1.1 =\u0026gt; /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.1 (0x00007f9571a00000) libc.so.6 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f9571846000) libz.so.1 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libz.so.1 (0x00007f9571d0f000) libdl.so.2 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f9571d0a000) libpthread.so.0 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f9571ce9000) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f9571dd6000) and then it\u0026rsquo;s very easy find the missing RDEPEND that must be fixed in the Macaroni repository:
$\u0026gt; luet q belongs libpopt.so.0 dev-libs/popt-1.16 In this case the library popt is missing on runtime_deps and you need to install it directly:

The whip-catalog is a YAML files catalog with bash/sh commands. If you find something missing or you have some idea about new hooks, please open a PR.
What next? Well, few is changed after the release 23.03 so, the open points are the same but we will push forward with a major priority the documentation. I hope that we will cover a good documentation part for the next release. Stay tuned!
We waiting for you We waiting for you in our Discord Server.
Thanks Many thanks to all Funtoo devs that are the sap of all this and to all people that helps us with testing and donations.

`}),e.add({id:4,href:"/blog/phoenix-23.03/",title:"Macaroni OS Phoenix 23.03 is out!",section:"Blog",content:`Finally, after two months of hard work, the release Phoenix 23.03 is out and is the first Desktop release under the new macaronios.org domain.
In these two months, we had to follow infrastructure issues (broken hard disks) and create the new Macaroni network. This is one of the reasons we have skipped the release of February.
We want to thank again the GARR consortium that is now our primary mirror under our CDN and this will permit in the next weeks to expose again the ISOs download page and our LXD images.
This release doesn\u0026rsquo;t expose extraordinary packages or upgrades but is a big milestone for us because a lot of our work is under the hood and will be better understood by the users in the next months when another big target will be reached: the creation of the Macaroni documentation.
A big milestone The first major target reached is the first big rewrite of the Macaroni PMS tool luet that now:
has a new solver completely rewritten that now respects repositories priorities, it\u0026rsquo;s 100x fast and consumes few memory. The only limit at the moment is that until the luet-build binary will be rewritten the repository metadata will be yet with a big YAML file that must be exploded at least one time when is called the luet repo update command but this will be fixed in the near future. This is been an important result to begin ARM integration
the integration of the new solver has permitted the creation of the mask packages feature. It works in a similar way to Funtoo portage and will be described in detail in the Macaroni documentation in the near future. This is an important result because will permit to supply multiple versions of the same package and using the mask feature to hide a specific version to a target rootfs. You can think of a package like NVIDIA drivers where legacy cards need to have a specific version, or again if a user wants to create their packages and hide the Macaroni version, etc.
the provides support is been reviewed to permit a good means to manage correctly packages that are replaced. The correct way to use provide is to define a specific version in the provides and not a selector. For example:
provides: - category: cat name: foo version: 0.1.0 the install command now doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to upgrade automatically the system; it just tries to resolve the dependencies and the packages selected and install them. This will permit to install of specific packages also when there are upgrades available.
the luet now permits to select of packages only by name. I really love this feature, because permits the reduction of the text written and speeds up the installation and research. For example:
$\u0026gt; luet i app-emulation/lxd-compose becomes:
$\u0026gt; luet i lxd-compose luet repo list command has now a new look and option:
$\u0026gt; luet repo list --urls geaaru-repo-index Geaaru Repository index Revision 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 UTC Priority 1 - Type http Urls: * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geaaru/repo-index/gh-pages macaroni-commons-dev Macaroni OS Commons Development Repository Revision 131 - 2023-03-08 22:17:57 +0000 UTC Priority 10 - Type http Urls: * https://dev.macaronios.org/macaroni-commons-dev/ macaroni-commons-testing Macaroni OS Commons Testing Repository Priority 20 - Type http Urls: * https://dl.macaronios.org/repos/macaroni-commons-testing/ * https://cdn2.macaronios.org/repos/macaroni-commons-testing/ * https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/repos/macaroni-commons-testing/ the original solvers are no more available and will be dropped from the code when also the luet-build binary will be rewritten.
The upgrades/installs output is now more clear with the cons that for now the download process is not parallel. This fixes the progress bar issues. We are working on following an output similar to portage that will be available in the next release 0.35.0.
We have begun to work on commands that permit configuring subsets but they are to be complete.
it\u0026rsquo;s now available a new command luet query orphans that permits retrieving all packages no more available in the enabled repository.
In general, now you can control with luet every action and package of your system. If there are issues in the new solver you aren\u0026rsquo;t blocked, you can manually fix issues with hidden (and for expert users) commands luet miner that will be described in the documentation.
This is what is been said from an user on testing the new luet binary:
Feels like you took a Ford Fiesta and turned it into a Ferrari
Really, thanks for this comment that will get me more power to go ahead.
A lot of new improvements and features are in our backlog.
An important thing that is not yet available is the possibility to downgrade the packages if I user wants to convert a rootfs updated with a testing repository to a stable repository. But is in our plan to add this feature soon.
ATTENTION: Due to all these changes, my suggestion is to upgrade this time the luet binary manually with a download from the site and the follow what is been described in the new FAQ section of the website.
$\u0026gt; sudo wget -O /usr/bin/luet https://github.com/geaaru/luet/releases/download/v0.34.2-geaaru/luet-v0.34.2-geaaru-Linux-x86_64 $\u0026gt; sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/luet We will improve this operation in the near future.
macaronictl gets power! The luet rewritten is not the only new improvement, the management CLI of Macaroni OS, macaronictl gets more power:
macaronictl env-update is been completely written in Golang following the same Funtoo/Gentoo logic. This permits to have Macaroni OS systems to the need to install the sys-apps/portage package. This migration is not yet completely completed but will be so in the next release.
macaronictl tool has a new etc-update command written in Golang that uses the same /etc/etc-update.conf config and it implements a similar logic to the Portage etc-update command.
macaronictl tool has a new kernel availables command that permit to retrieve all kernel available from the enabled repositories and supply some metadata:
$\u0026gt; macaronictl kernel availables --lts | KERNEL | KERNEL VERSION | PACKAGE VERSION | EOL | LTS | RELEASED | TYPE | |----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|------|------------|---------| | macaroni | 4.14.305 | 4.14.305 | Jan, 2024 | true | 2017-11-12 | vanilla | | macaroni | 5.10.168 | 5.10.168 | Dec, 2026 | true | 2020-12-13 | vanilla | | macaroni | 5.15.94 | 5.15.94 | Oct, 2026 | true | 2021-10-31 | vanilla | | macaroni | 5.4.231 | 5.4.231 | Dec, 2025 | true | 2019-11-24 | vanilla | | macaroni | 6.1.12 | 6.1.12 | Dec, 2026 | true | 2022-12-11 | vanilla | This will help with the feature that will be available in the next future to switch between kernels.
Funtoo integration (experimental) In the middle of all the new implementations we have released a new release of the luet-portage-converter tool that is used normally to generate automatically updates from our luet specs.
I hope that this will be a lovely experience for the Funtoo users.
I will leave users with a bit of suspense until I will write the documentation in the next weeks but the new luet-portage-converter sync command will permits:
convert a Funtoo system to a Macaroni OS and get updates from Macaroni or restore the broken system.
sync with the Macaroni PMS the packages installed with emerge to the luet database and/or sync packages previously installed with luet and then upgraded with emerge.
Obviously, to use these features is needed a Macaroni OS with subsets portage and devel enabled.
ATTENTION: This new command is pretty experimental and must be used carefour.
Domain migration again I\u0026rsquo;m sorry but after the integration of the Consortium GARR I reviewed the stable domains with a CDN chain. I added in the FAQ section of the website some tips about easily upgrading the repositories. I hope that things will be more stable now but using free services has some cons.
What\u0026rsquo;s new This new release has some interesting updates:
LXD 5.11 and LXC 5.0.2
Libreoffice 7.5.0.3
Firefox 1.109.0.1
Brave 1.48.158
Grafana 9.3.6 and Prometheus 2.42.0
Blender 3.4.1
ZFS 2.1.9
KDE Framework 5.85.5 and KDE Plasma 5.22.5
Openshot video editing tool updated to release 2.6.1
Cinelerra is been dropped. The website has tons of forks without a tag and it seems hard to maintain.
Grub 2.04 with patch related to the use of new e2fsprogs v.1.47.0. See debian issue.
Open VMtools 12.1.5
All kernels modules are been renamed following the naming convention: kernel-\u0026lt;kernel-branch\u0026gt; as category. This will help searching and macaronictl integration. Always related to the kernel, the string LTS is been removed from kernel packages. The LTS information is now available over the package annotations.
See the release page for the detail of all updates.
What next? Hereinafter, our hot points for the next releases:
Drop support to Python 2.7 from Phoenix and leave Python 3.7 only. We will upgrade to Python 3.9 later.
Continue to work begun on writing documentation and FAQ for users.
Begin the rewrite of luet-build binary and improve look\u0026amp;feel of the luet output.
Add the new ISOs webpage and prepare the release of the ISO 23.03. We need to wait for the sync of the GARR mirror and the propagation.
Add new features to luet-portage-converter to manage multiple versions of the same package.
Add new features to macaronictl tool
Add Macaroni OS LXD images to images.linuxcontainers.org.

What next? Hereinafter, our hot points for the near future:
We working to complete the review of the luet installer and his algorithms to reduce the memory usage, rewrite the solver and introduce the packages mask concept. This will permit us to begin on working a Macaroni release for ARM (Banana PI, Raspberry).
The terragon release will drop the support to Python 3.7 to leave active only Python 3.9.
Create a full and clear documentation of all Macaroni features.
When the first two points will be reached will start the integration of macaroni-ffs project related to the Funtoo FFS technology and permit users to have easy the toolchains for compilation
A lot of things are in our plan, stay tuned!
Additional thanks On setup of the new infrastructure, I want to thank the all people who helped me in setting up the Cloudflare services in about two days. Really, thanks.

`}),e.add({id:8,href:"/docs/getting-started/",title:"Getting Started",section:"Macaroni OS",content:` Getting Started # Install Macaroni ISO # Choice the right ISO for your requirements from our Download page.
1.Validate downloaded ISO # After the you have downloaded the ISOs file, I suggest to verify the quality of the download throw our SHA256 hash:
$ sha256sum Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso 8637d8c6ba72f8694aabd631f038473acaadd0fbb8fc9fa7cec7bb0d495f1f54 Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso $ cat Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso.sha256 8637d8c6ba72f8694aabd631f038473acaadd0fbb8fc9fa7cec7bb0d495f1f54 If the download is correct the hash will be the same.
Until the issue #7 will be fixed you need to compare the sha256 manually.
2.Flash your USB drive # To write an ISO there are different tools and ways. My suggestion is to use the wonderful tool Balena Etcher that validate the written bytes before share the result.
NOTE: At the moment the ventoy USB Solution is not supported.
3.Check your BIOS # At the moment, the Macaroni ISOs don\u0026rsquo;t support an EFI-signed bootstrap. So, before bootstrapping your USB drive just check and disable EFI security check.
Hereinafter is an example of how setup the right options:
Normally, based on device there are different way to enter on BIOS, through F10, Canc, F2. You need to check your device manual.
4.Boot the ISO # When the Menu is visible could be possible customize boot options with E keyboard button. After push to E keyboard button compares in the foot the default command line options where you can add every kernel options.
Disable Nouveau driver # By default we prefer using nouveau driver for the NVIDIA cards on bootstrap our live ISOs. But it\u0026rsquo;s possible that some new cards could be not be yet supported.
To force the loading of the NVIDIA kernel module you can add this option:
modprobe.blacklist=nouveau Enter in the ISO bootstrap shell # If there are issues on bootstrap correctly the Macaroni ISOs you can enter in the initrd shell and to recover informations about your system and help us to check what happens.
To enter in the shell before the probing of the ISO squashfs to debug the probing phase and the switch root command you need to add shell=1 as option.
ISOLinux bootstrap # The described option at the moment are not available in the ISOLinux menu visible hereinafter:
The ISOLinux menu normally is available for not-EFI systems.
5. Start Installer # All our ISOs are configured with Network Manager by default which is better integrated with the Calamares installer. You are free to disable and change it later when the system is installed.
The default user of Macaroni ISO is macaroni with password macaroni.
Server ISO # The Server ISO automatically starts an X server with Calamares without a Desktop Environment.
The X server available with the Server ISO is limited. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a network with DHCP you can change the tty and using nmtui to setup Networking correctly.
XFCE ISO # To start the Macaroni Installer click to Install System from Applications ‚Üí System ‚Üí Install System.
Gnome ISO # To start the Macaroni installer you need to enter on Applications dashboard and search for install:
6. Follow Installer workflow # 6.1 Welcome: Select Language # In this page if the installer detects correctly at least one hard drive is present the first choice of the user: the select of the language.
At the moment the tested languages are English and Italian but other languages are available. If you find some problem with the other languages open an issue.
6.2 Location: Select Region and Zone # The second page of the installer permits to configure the Region and the timzone.
Choice the right value from the map and go ahead.
6.3 Keyboard: Select Keyboard Model and Language # The third page of the installer permits to configure the Keyboard Model and the langauge.
6.4 Partitions: Select storage device and Partitions # In this page you need to select the storage device from the menu and choice how the installer will prepare the partitions.
If the selected this is empty the installer will propose only two voices: Erase disk and Manual partitioning.
If you try to reinstall Macaroni OS to an existing system and/or replace existing partitions you can select the voice Replace a partition:
If you are a newbie, my suggestion is to use the self partitioning mode from the Macaroni Installer that automatically define three main parititions: efi boot (if you are in EFI env), Swap partition and a Root partition for all data.
Encrypt Full Disk # Macaroni support Encryption of full system, the only partition left in clear is the EFI partition.
To enable the encryption you need to flag Encrypt system and write the passphrase as visible in the screenshot hereinafter:
With the set Encrypt System also the swap partition will be encrypted. The passphrase will be ask on GRUB before to print the Menu.
Manual Partitioning # An expert user could create his custom installation with different partitions, for example, to divide /var/ from /, etc.
Encrypt Home Partition Only # Personally, I think that could be a good compromise to have the rootfs without encryption, this takes things easier on restoring a broken system and instead encrypt the home with user data.
This is possible from Manual Partioning on creating an encrypted partition.
To this it\u0026rsquo;s only needed after selecting the File System type (in the screenshot ext4), to set the Encrypt flag and set the passphrase.
NOTE: On setup, with a configuration with there are single partitions encrypted you need to do some manual operations when the installation is completed or at the first boot. Unfortunately, at the moment the configuration of a single encrypted partition is not handled correctly and automatically by the Calamares installer. So, these steps will be described later.
6.5 Users: Define User and Passwords # It\u0026rsquo;s now time to define the user of your system, write your name and the name of your computer and choice your password.
Normally, the defined user will be the admin user and the same password will be used for root. If you want a different password for root, you need to disable the flag related to the option: Use the same password for the administrator account.
6.6 Summary: Show configured options # At this point, you are near to starting the installation of your Macaroni OS system.
Just check the selected options before starting the installation.
If all is ok, go ahead with Install button.
6.7 Install: The Installation is started # Finally, the Macaroni Installer begins to write your hard drive. The time needed depends on your hardware and the speed of the hard drive.
6.8 Finish: The Installation is completed # Wohoo! Your Macaroni system is ready!
Set the Restart now flag to reboot your computer and to start your Macaroni OS.
6.9 The First boot # Full Encrypted Disk # If you have choice to encrypt the full disk on bootstrap the GRUB will ask for the passphrase inserted in installation phase before display the GRUB menu and go ahead with the bootstrap of your system.
Hereinafter, an example of what could be happens:
Complete the setup of Home\u0026rsquo;s encrypted partition # If you have encrypted only the home partition or any other partition with the workflow described before to have the installation correctly working you need to execute few steps.
a. Retrieve the LUKS filesystem Id
# cat /etc/fstab # /etc/fstab: static file system information. # # Use \u0026#39;blkid\u0026#39; to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may # be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if # disks are added and removed. See fstab(5). # # \u0026lt;file system\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mount point\u0026gt; \u0026lt;type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;options\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dump\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pass\u0026gt; UUID=ABF5-91D0 /boot/efi vfat defaults,noatime 0 2 UUID=f202c1d1-b131-45f5-8973-8f82cb63d688 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1 /dev/mapper/luks-f1504aa0-2594-4221-b741-7ba315b47de0 /home ext4 defaults,noatime 0 2 In this case the needed value is f1504aa0-2594-4221-b741-7ba315b47de0.
b. Editing the GRUB configuration file /etc/default/grub and add this option:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\u0026#34;rd.luks.uuid=f1504aa0-2594-4221-b741-7ba315b47de0\u0026#34; Where it\u0026rsquo;s used the LUKS filesystem ID with the option rd.luks.uuid that say to dracut to manage the prompt on Plymouth for uncrypt the home partition before start X.
c. Rebuild the initramfs image with macaronictl
$\u0026gt; macaronictl kernel gi --all --grub Creating initrd image /boot/initramfs-vanilla-x86_64-6.1.18-macaroni...DONE Creating grub config file /boot/grub/grub.cfg... Generating grub configuration file ...

Falling back to device scanning. done d. Check dmcrypt service
Ensure that the dmcrypt service is enabled on boot runlevel:
$\u0026gt; rc-update show NetworkManager | default avahi-daemon | default binfmt | boot bluetooth | default bootmisc | boot cgroups | sysinit dbus | boot devfs | sysinit device-mapper | sysinit dmcrypt | boot ... Enable it if it\u0026rsquo;s not available with:
$\u0026gt; rc-update add dmcrypt boot e. Reboot your system.
If all is been configured correctly on bootstrap you will see the Plymouth page with the prompt where insert the passphrase to mount home partition:
Install Macaroni LXD Containers # Macaroni OS supply their LXD images over a Simplestreams Server with help of the simplestreams-builder tool.
To configure your LXD system to download Macaroni OS images you need to add the macaroni remote:
$\u0026gt; lxc remote add macaroni https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/images/lxd-images --protocol simplestreams --public The images are visible with the command:
$\u0026gt; lxc image list macaroni: Install Macaroni Docker Containers # The official Docker Hub user is macaronios.
To play with Macaroni just create your container:
$\u0026gt; docker run --rm -ti macaronios/terragon-minimal:latest-amd64 And then install your packages:

You know, the world is buggy, it\u0026rsquo;s better to have a way to check and resolve the problems fast.
In the middle of the story, Macaroni OS wants to be an optimized distro for LXD containers, Docker and Singularity.
So, in summary, these are the core targets of the Macaroni OS Linux:
Container Optimized Through the subsets feature of the Luet tool will make it easy to have a thin rootfs and customize the files installed from a package and run CD/CI tasks and/or pipeline fast. Automation Share a way to build packages without a giant infrastructure but with the pros of CD/CI. Macaroni developer teams share how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to do this through lxd-compose or with a more scalable solution through Mottainai Server. Revolution Hotspot To be a good start point for revolutions within the Linux OS space with the synergy of the Funtoo Team. Macaroni Releases # Following the core targets just described in Macaroni there are different releases:
Release Codename Funtoo Release Description Phoenix 1.4-prime The core release based on OpenRC/SysVinit for Server and Desktop Eagle 1.4-prime + patches A Funtoo SystemD release. The idea is to use it only for Server target and as experimental base rootfs where we will develop an alternative tool that will replace SystemD probably written in Golang but that will be compatible with part of SystemD files. In this moment, this release has only Container based targets and Server services. Terragon next The next release based on OpenRC/SysVinit Funtoo system with Container oriented use flags. Macaroni OS Phoenix # The Phoenix release is the first release created and the only release at the moment for the Desktop. The codename phoenix is related to the immortal bird associated with Greek mythology that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor. This is the reason I choose this name: to describe a new beginning and to remember us that also when others try to stop a dream, with the commitment it\u0026rsquo;s possible reborn and goes ahead.
In phoenix it\u0026rsquo;s used the OpenRC as an init system, it\u0026rsquo;s based on Funtoo 1.4-prime and so:
* GCC 9.2.0 * Glibc 2.33 * Python 3.7 (2.7 is available but will be dropped in the near future) * LLVM 11 The desktop environments available in this release are:
Desktop Environment Version Status ISO Available Gnome 3.36 stable yes XFCE 4.16 stable yes Enlightenment 0.25.4 experimental no KDE 5.22 experimental no As the first release a lot of things could be improved but it\u0026rsquo;s also true that the Desktop is something complex that requires a lot of effort and computing. We will work to clean up things and speed up the building phase that now it\u0026rsquo;s very expensive, in particular for the build of the funtoo-base seed based on Gnome Funtoo stage3.
Macaroni OS Eagle # The Eagle release is born to be used in container, it\u0026rsquo;s based on Funtoo 1.4-prime with patches to integrate SystemD as an init system.
Without the need to support the Desktop, the release is been compiled with server-oriented and X-less use flags. This permits to have core packages fewer dependencies and more optimized for containers.
Like phoenix also eagle is based on Funtoo 1.4-prime and so:
* GCC 9.2.0 * Glibc 2.33 * Python 3.7 (2.7 is available but will be dropped in the near future) * LLVM 11 Macaroni OS Terragon # The Terragon release is born to be used in container and it\u0026rsquo;s based on Funtoo Next that is the more innovative release of Funtoo.
Like for eagle release the terragon release is been compiled with server-oriented and X-less use flags.
Based on Funtoo Next some core packages are:
* GCC 11.3.0 * Glibc 2.33 * Python 3.9 Macaroni Repositories # We have three different repositories for any release: a stable repository, a testing repository and, a development repository.
Hereinafter, a summary of our repositories and the packages related.
Repository Stable Testing Development macaroni-commons repository/macaroni-commons repository/macaroni-commons-testing repository/macaroni-commons-dev mottainai repository/mottainai-stable repository/mottainai-testing repository/mottainai-dev macaroni-funtoo repository/macaroni-funtoo repository/macaroni-funtoo-testing repository/macaroni-funtoo-dev macaroni-funtoo-systemd repository/macaroni-funtoo-systemd repository/macaroni-funtoo-systemd-testing repository/macaroni-funtoo-systemd-dev macaroni-terragon repository/macaroni-terragon repository/macaroni-terragon-testing repository/macaroni-terragon-dev NOTE: The development repositories must be used only by the Staff and are attached to the Macaroni/Mottainai CD/CI flows. The origin server has limited bandwidth so please, use them only for emergencies and/or in collaboration with the Macaroni Team.
Macaroni Commons # The macaroni-commons repository contains the specs for building the Macaroni OS packages common to all releases and all packages compiled without Portage integration.
In particular, in this repository are maintained the Macaroni Kernels.
Normally, this repository is installed by default and present in all Macaroni releases.
Mottainai # The Macaroni Team supports the MottainaiCI organization and the mottainai-stable repository is used to supply the Mottainai tools and luet.
The luet PMS could be used inside other distributions and it makes sense to avoid having a macaroni-commons repository to install and upgrade it. This is the reason we have left our PMS in an independent repository.
Normally, this repository is installed by default.
Macaroni Funtoo # The macaroni-funtoo repository is the repository of the Phoenix release.
Normally, this repository is installed by default in all Phoenix installation.
Macaroni Funtoo SystemD # The macaroni-funtoo-systemd repository is the repository of the Eagle release.
Normally, this repository is installed by default in all Eagle installation.
Macaroni Terragon # The macaroni-terragon repository is the repository of the Terragon release.
Normally, this repository is installed by default in all Terragon installation.
Macaroni Tags # In Macaroni the tag means that a specific release is been promoted for the stable repository. Every stable repository contains only a tagged release. There are very few exceptions where I pushed packages in the stable repository that was not related to a tag, and this is been happen for emergency fixes that are been follow soon by a new minor tag.
So, we could consider Macaroni as a rolling release distribution with periodic tags and upgrades.
This choice has pros and cons:
A user that using stable release could easier integration their package based on known packages version and use the specific tree fetched by the tag of the macaroni-funtoo repository to build additional packages. Executing a backup of the Macaroni repository for a specific tag permits him to have a reproducible way to upgrade, install and build packages from a fixed point.
Having a static list of the package version for a specific tag helps IT Teams with the auditing of security issues to have uniform environments controllable.
Wait for a new tag for a security issue could be not an optimal condition, but from my experience, it\u0026rsquo;s often more the time to wait for a fix than the time to release a new tag. By the way, to fix this issue the idea could be to prepare a macaroni-security repository to use in these emergency cases without waiting for a new tag that could be require more time if a build cycle is in progress.
In the Production environment I think that it\u0026rsquo;s better to supply services over container LXD, Docker, or Singularity and thus ensure a more rapid fix of the security issues. In general, the releases Macaroni Terragon and Macaroni Eagle have a more fast build cycle and this permits us to push a more fast fix.
We want to try to follow these periodic tags on our Releases:
Release Rolling Tags Macaroni OS Phoenix every 2 months Macaroni OS Terragon monthly Macaroni OS Eagle monthly It\u0026rsquo;s also possible that minor releases will be tagged in addition to the scheduled tags. The Phoenix for the Desktop requires a lot of effort and testing, this is the reason why the release will be less frequent. We\u0026rsquo;re working to reorganize the tree to speed up the build cycle but this is the job of the next months.
`}),e.add({id:10,href:"/docs/networking/",title:"Networking",section:"Macaroni OS",content:` Networking # Macaroni OS inherits all network configuration ways from Funtoo. In particular, every release could contain one or more ways and/or technologies.
Hereinafter, a table with the different technologies and the availability in the Macaroni releases.
Technology Release Phoenix Release Terragon Release Eagle Network Manager Yes Yes Yes Core Network Yes Yes No SystemD Networkd No No Yes In our ISOs, we use Network Manager that is which seems better integrated with Calamares Installer.
For Server ISO our suggestion is to disable Network Manager when the installation is done and to use the core network scripts.
1. Network Manager # NetworkManager is the standard Linux network configuration tool suite that in the years is been integrated over different desktop environments. It\u0026rsquo;s the default service used by Gnome and could be configured in the different way.
If the service is active, normally, the default configuration automatically uses DHCP protocol on the enabled network interfaces.
From terminal could be used the nmtui tool and nmcli to configure the network.
The package that supplies this service is net-misc/networkmanager and could be extended with extra plugins.

nmcli # The nmcli tool is parte of the network-manager package and could be used to check the status of the setup of the Network Manager from the terminal.

nmtui # The nmtui tool is part of the network-manager package and supply a terminal interface based on ncurses library to configure the connections.
Network Manager and LXD # By default Network Manager automatically tries to configure and enable every new interface added to the system and this could be correct when LXD is used.
It\u0026rsquo;s possible to disable this behavior for specific interfaces with the creation of the the file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf or editing it if it\u0026rsquo;s already present and to add the keyfile plugin as reported hereinafter:
[main] plugins=keyfile #[logging] #domains=ALL:TRACE [keyfile] unmanaged-devices=interface-name:veth*,interface-name:mottainai0,interface-name:br-int0,interface-name:ovs* In the example, the interfaces starting with veth or ovs and the interfaces mottainai0 and br-int0 are ignored by NM.
2. Core Network # Inherit from Funtoo for the OpenRC systems, so for both Phoenix and Terragon releases the corenetwork package contains the Funtoo scripts to use for configure the network interfaces on boot.
The concept about the interfaces configuration is that for every interface it\u0026rsquo;s needed create under the directory /etc/init.d the link in the format netif.\u0026lt;iface-name\u0026gt; to the netif.templ file with and then to create the related file under the directory /etc/conf.d/ with the naming convention netif.\u0026lt;iface-name\u0026gt;.
The corenetwork package supplies different templates to use different technologies and/or for different targets. For example, the DHCP could be managed with the tool dhcpd or with dhclient. Every specific template as specific configuration options.
The supported templates are available under the directory /etc/netif.d and in this moment are these:
# luet q files corenetwork | grep netif.d etc/netif.d/bond etc/netif.d/bridge etc/netif.d/bridge-dhcpcd etc/netif.d/bridge-openvswitch etc/netif.d/dhclient etc/netif.d/dhcpcd etc/netif.d/hostapd etc/netif.d/interface etc/netif.d/interface-noip etc/netif.d/ipv6-tunnel etc/netif.d/macvlan etc/netif.d/macvtap etc/netif.d/pppd etc/netif.d/tap etc/netif.d/tunnel etc/netif.d/wireguard etc/netif.d/wpa_supplicant Setup a DHCP interface using the dhcpd template # These the steps to setup the interface eth0 with the DHCP.
root $\u0026gt; cd /etc/init.d root $\u0026gt; ln -s netif.tmpl netif.eth0 root $\u0026gt; rc-update add netif.eth0 default root $\u0026gt; echo template=dhcpcd \u0026gt; /etc/conf.d/netif.eth0 Setup an interface with a static IP # To configure an interface with a static IP it\u0026rsquo;s used the interface template that could be configured with this steps:
root $\u0026gt; cd /etc/init.d root $\u0026gt; ln -s netif.tmpl netif.eth0 root $\u0026gt; rc-update add netif.eth0 default and then editing the file /etc/conf.d/netif.eth0 with this content:
template=\u0026#34;interface\u0026#34; ipaddr=\u0026#34;10.0.1.200/24\u0026#34; gateway=\u0026#34;10.0.1.1\u0026#34; nameservers=\u0026#34;1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8\u0026#34; domain=\u0026#34;mottainai.local\u0026#34; A more completed documentation is available directly from the Funtoo wiki.
3. Systemd Networkd # In the only Eagle release where it\u0026rsquo;s used Systemd could be used the systemd-networkd service for the network configuration.
The configuration files are available under the directory /etc/systemd/network with the extension .network.
For example to configure DHCP on interface eth0 it\u0026rsquo;s possible to create the file /etc/systemd/network/default_dhcp.network with the following content:
[Network] DHCP=ipv4 [Match] Name=eth0 [DHCP] UseDomains=true After the editing and/or creation of the files under /etc/systemd/network to apply the configuration is needed following the commands:
$\u0026gt; systemctl daemon-reload $\u0026gt; systemctl restart systemd-networkd The complete description of all availables options is present on the Freedesktop Website.
`}),e.add({id:11,href:"/docs/story/",title:"The Story",section:"Macaroni OS",content:`I write this article because I think that it\u0026rsquo;s needed to understand the story to improve things and instead follow the original choices when they make sense.
The Origins # After a lot of years working with opensource packages, I can for sure to said that there are so many possibilities to configure our systems that it isn\u0026rsquo;t sufficient one life to test all combinations.
But the power to choose is one of the more powerful things that the open-source world gift and the same packages often are created with the possibility to compile and build them in different ways. Also, the compiler used to compile and build a package supplies a lot of options to compile, optimize and validate the code (for example using -O2 or -O3 options) and this introduces again others combinations.
On August 21, 1994, Jordan Hubbard committed his port make macros to the FreeBSD CVS repository, and the FreeBSD ports is born. The FreeBSD ports through Makefile, supplies a way to define how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to compile a package and what are the knobs (or options) available to customize the compilation. So, the FreeBSD ports defines a way to supply metadata with the rules for compiling packages and optionally customize the configure options.
Following the concept to optimize the packages of a system based on specific hardware optimization in December 1999, Daniel Robbins initially created Gentoo Linux (previously called Enoch Linux). Daniel Robbins and the other contributors experimented with a fork of GCC known as EGCS, developed by Cygnus Solutions. At this point, \u0026ldquo;Enoch\u0026rdquo; was renamed \u0026ldquo;Gentoo\u0026rdquo; Linux (the Gentoo species is the fastest-swimming penguin). The modifications to EGCS eventually became part of the official GCC (version 2.95), and other Linux distributions experienced similar speed increases. After problems with a bug on his own system, Robbins halted Gentoo development and switched to FreeBSD for several months, later saying, \u0026ldquo;I decided to add several FreeBSD features to make our autobuild system (now called Portage) a true next-generation ports system\u0026rdquo;.
Gentoo Linux 1.0 was released on March 31, 2002. In 2004, Robbins set up the non-profit Gentoo Foundation, transferred all copyrights and trademarks to it, and stepped down as chief architect of the project.
Gentoo is a source-based distribution with a repository describing how to build the packages, and adding instructions to build on different machine architectures. In particular, the rules about how build a package are defined inside Ebuild files and on Eclasses files which are both files using Bash language. The Portage written in Python is the Package Manager System that calculates dependencies and the order to build using the underlying rules read from the Ebuild and Eclass files.
What are called knobs on FreeBSD in Gentoo are called USE flags.
Inside an ebuild there are some important pieces of information in addition to the rules about how to compile a package, pieces of information defined inside Bash variables:
IUSE: The list of the USE flags that an user could select or not to configure the build process.
DEPEND, PDEPEND, and BDEPEND: these variables contain the list of the packages needed to compile the package
RDEPEND: contains the list of the packages needed at runtime to use the package.
These pieces of information with others are what is called the metadata of the package and for an installed package are visible under the directory /var/db/pkg.
In Macaroni, like in both binary luet-portage-converter and luet we use code available in the pkgs-checker tool that I written in Golang that between the rest, it has a way to retrieve package metadata and convert them to JSON:
$\u0026gt; sudo pkgs-checker portage metadata app-emulation/lxd -j | jq [ { \u0026#34;package\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lxd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;app-emulation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;5.12\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;slot\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Condition\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;repository\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;geaaru-kit\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;use_flags\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;-apparmor\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ipv6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-nios2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nls\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-sh\u0026#34;

The Portage together with the Ebuild is a very powerful tool to compile and customize packages and the OS.
I began to play with Gentoo around the year 2003 when I was a student at the Computer Science University and in one of my first job. Yet, I remember now how much time was needed to compile the kernel in a Pentium 233Mhz (if I remember correctly the model) and how much time I used to improve the old systems and yet, how much time to download tarball with a 56Kbit Analogic Line. Gentoo helped a lot with this.
Compile everything and every time could be more expensive as time and costs, it\u0026rsquo;s so in 2005 is created Sabayon Linux or Sabayon (formerly RR4 Linux and RR64 Linux), an Italian Gentoo-based Linux distribution created by Fabio Erculiani. Sabayon followed the \u0026ldquo;out of the box\u0026rdquo; philosophy, aiming to give the user a wide number of applications ready to use and a self-configured operating system.
The Sabayon\u0026rsquo;s Package Management System called Entropy, developed by Fabio Erculiani and others extends the Gentoo Portage. The Portage downloads source-code and compiles it specifically for the target system, Entropy manages binary files from servers; the binary tarball packages are precompiled using the Gentoo Linux tree using emerge (the Portage tool).
On the other side of the world, at the beginning of 2008, is created the Funtoo Linux Linux distribution based on Gentoo Linux. It was created by Daniel Robbins after that the Gentoo Foundation doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to follow the ideas proposed by Robbins.
Between battles with Solaris servers and Debian\u0026rsquo;s VMs on beginning working on supplying ready-to-use binary packages for my Clients, my colleague, and friend Walter Curtetti (aka kurtz81) shared with me a new Distribution that is based on Gentoo: Sabayon. So, in 2010, I started my interest on follow the Sabayon Team before as a Contributor and then as Developer in 2018.
In my years in Sabayon, I saw different things happen and I learn what are the areas that could be improved in a distribution and/or critical:
The Sabayon\u0026rsquo;s Packages Manager is written in Python and every time a new release of Python (for example from 3.6 to 3.7) was upgraded it was needed to support both releases for a bit of time and then to drop the previous to do an upgrade safe.
The big change in converting the /lib from a link to a directory it\u0026rsquo;s been a disaster, but it\u0026rsquo;s funny now to see the new SystemD release now prefers the old way with /lib and /usr/lib as links.
The pros to having Entropy as an extension of the Portage are fewer of the cons when Gentoo had to begin to do changes to the Portage that was not so easy to integrate with a code old to rewrite.
Supply a way for users to build additional packages through the SARK engine was really difficult because the Portage tree changes so fastly that was injected often dependencies that were for the sabayon core repository. We have tried with a Portage tree fixed to a specific Git Hash but also in this case sometimes wasn\u0026rsquo;t sufficient.
Entropy doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle correctly a reboot of a repository or only with forcing the sync of the repository.
With these words I don\u0026rsquo;t want to say that Entropy was bad, instead, it\u0026rsquo;s been a good product but without good maintenance of the code, it becomes slowly obsolete and too hard to fix.
After years, what is been an important element for the change is been following a path where the PMS was statically linked, without dependencies to other elements of the system that could be a problem in the upgrade phase. And so, in 2019/2020, this idea became real through a tool written in Golang: and it that born the luet project. With the release of the first versions, we have decided to a rebranding with the name Mocaccino OS.
The luet project was born to be a tool that is no more strictly connected to a specific compilation engine, thanks to the experience had with Entropy, but also free to use existing compilation systems without losing the prons. To reach this target it uses primarily Docker containers and this ensures reproducibility and isolation. Thanks to this independence, luet can be used to supply generic binary from every distributions.
The second big problem to resolve is been to have a more managed environment where builds and upgrades packages at the same time in a way independent but more controlled. It\u0026rsquo;s here that I began to work with integration between Mocaccino and Funtoo because it seems to me a better solution than Gentoo for our targets. I really appreciate the separation done by Funtoo in Kits and the use of branches to separate the big changes and personally, I think that these are been a very good choice by Daniel Robbins.
This integration starts my collaboration with Daniel Robbins and the announcement of the joining between Sabayon and Funtoo to work together.
Thanks to the support of Daniel Robbins, the reposcan tool was borns inside the metatools project to help in this integration. The reposcan tool generates the JSON files with the Portage metadata of every kit, these files are then used by the luet-portage-converter tool to generate the luet specs used for build packages.
The luet-portage-converter tool uses the reposcan files to calculate the build dependencies like the runtime dependencies based on the USE flags defined in its specs and then executes simplification stages to reduce the dependencies complexity. For example, if dependency A is an RDEPEND of the package B and C and package C has also a dependency to B, then we could avoid adding A as a dependency of C because is already injected by B.
Macaroni OS Era begins # In the middle of all this, at some point, my ideas about proceeding and changing luet, to continue the Funtoo integration, and with the Mocaccino Desktop release begins to be considered wrong and not accepted. In December 2021, I left the Sabayon/Mocaccino Team and create the Macaroni OS Project with the precious support of Daniel Robbins that help me bootstrap the domain macaroni.funtoo.org under the Funtoo umbrella.
In January 2023, I buy the domain macaronios.org and create the Github project macaroni-os so that the Macaroni OS became an independent project always strictly related to the Funtoo Community.
I want to thank every people that this long story is been part of it, in the bad and in the good, without you all of this will not be present. Good luck and good life to all of you.
And so, this is the begin\u0026hellip;
