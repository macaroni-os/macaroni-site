In the last period due to the changes in the new domain and the stabilization of the Macaroni infra there are been a lot of changes in the repository URLs. Working with donated resources and/or free resources has the consequence that the changes could happen.
So, I will describe the better way to upgrade safe our repositories.
a) leave only the geaaru-repo-index repository enabled. This means to call luet repo disable for all others repositories
$# luet repo disable macaroni-commons mottainai-stable macaroni-funtoo $# luet repo list --enabled geaaru-repo-index Macaroni OS Repository Index Revision 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 -00 Priority 1 - Type http b) At this point, it\u0026rsquo;s possible update the repository and get the new urls:
$# luet repo update üè† Repository: geaaru-repo-index Revision: 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 -00 $# luet upgrade The upgrade creates the files /etc/luet/repos.conf.d/._cfg_\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.yml that could be merged with the command etc-update (in the old system) or with the command macaronictl etc-update in the more updated systems.
After the upgrade and the merge of the new configs the system is ready for the updates: luet repo update and luet upgrade.
It\u0026rsquo;s possible check the repositories urls with:
# luet repo list --urls --enabled geaaru-repo-index Geaaru Repository index Revision 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 UTC Priority 1 - Type http Urls: * https://cdn.macaronios.org/mottainai/geaaru-repo-index macaroni-commons-dev Macaroni OS Commons Development Repository Revision 129 - 2023-03-03 22:16:31 +0000 UTC Priority 10 - Type http Urls: * https://dev.macaronios.org/macaroni-commons-dev/ macaroni-funtoo-systemd-dev Macaroni OS Funtoo Eagle Develop Repository Revision 452 - 2023-02-26 11:14:32 +0000 UTC Priority 2 - Type http Urls: * https://images.macaronios.org/macaroni-funtoo-systemd-dev/ mottainai-dev Mottainai Development Repository Revision 72 - 2023-02-25 23:47:52 +0000 UTC Priority 10 - Type http Urls: * https://dev.macaronios.org/mottainai-dev/ mottainai-stable Mottainai official Repository Revision 72 - 2023-02-25 23:47:52 +0000 UTC Priority 30 - Type http Urls: * https://dl.macaronios.org/repos/mottainai/ * https://cdn2.macaronios.org/repos/mottainai/ * https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/repos/mottainai/ 2. What to do after the upgrade of the luet binary? I leave this point in the FAQ because I began to rewrite the Macaroni PMS and until I will rewrite the luet-build binary the luet repo update command executes some post-fetch operations on the downloaded tree to speed up the research, and to have the files used by the new solver available in the luet version 0.33.0 and followed.
So, after the upgrade of luet there are two things that is better to do:
$# luet database reindex This will rebuild the Bolt Database indexes and
$# luet repo update --force that download and executes again the post-fetch hooks in the downloaded tree.
One of the errors reported by the users when is not executed a full fetch of the Macaroni repositories after the upgrade is this:
ü§î Computing upgrade, please hang tight... üí§ Error: Package net-libs-4/webkit not found on map 3. Why luet search doesn\u0026rsquo;t return packages? Excluding the search of the packages installed, i mean with the --installed option, the luet search command works only when the enabled repositories are been synced.
It\u0026rsquo;s just needed to download one time the repositories tree and then all works fine.
$# luet repo update ... $# luet s macaronictl app-admin/macaronictl-0.6.2 app-admin/macaronictl-thin-0.6.2 # luet s portage-converter macaroni/luet-portage-converter-0.11.2 `}),e.add({id:2,href:"/blog/phoenix-23.03.01/",title:"Macaroni OS Phoenix 23.03.01 is out!",section:"Blog",content:`While we have worked on preparing the new ISOs for the release 23.03 we have figured out that was better to bump a new release with the changes of the Calamares plugin to migrate our ISOs to kernel 6.1. In particular, the ISOs for Desktops have now the kernel 6.1.18 with built-in integration with new Realtek wifi cards. Unluckily not yet the cards 8852b e 8852be that will be available on branch 6.2. We will try to support it on kernel 6.1 with an external driver in the next release.
The Server ISOs maintain the kernel 5.10 LTS.
This is the reason for this delay and this micro-release.
We share in addition, that testing the Firefox release 109.0.1 that is been released on release 23.01 has figured out that there are some issues with NVIDIA cards. The Firefox windows were stalled often and only disabling hardware acceleration fixed this issue. So, please, if users have some similar experience with release 111.0 open an issue.
The new Download page We are very happy to share finally the new Download page where retrieve the new ISOs is now available. Inside the Download page we have tried to use a labels view that we hope will help users to choose the right ISOs for their requirements. Any feedback about this will help, thanks.
macaronictl gets again power! After receive tons of requests about integrate a switch command to upgrade the kernel release, we are happy to share that the time is arrived\u0026hellip;
The macaronictl release 0.8.0 contains these new commands and improvements:

Whip power! With little steps, we improve our knife swiss that is used to post-install hooks and for validation. In this release, we have added new important hooks to the whip catalog:
linking.check: This hook permit to validation of existing installation and search for libraries or binary with a broken link. So, if you find some issue with running this in a clean installation, please, open an issue.
For example, on Eagle release I found this issue that permits to be fixed very fast until the fix will be available on the repository:
$\u0026gt; whip h linking.check Checking directory /usr/lib64... Checking directory /usr/lib... Checking directory /usr/bin... /usr/bin/rsync Checking directory /bin... Checking directory /usr/sbin... Checking directory /usr/libexec... [linking.check] Completed correctly. The rsync binary seems broken:
$\u0026gt; ldd /usr/bin/rsync linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcb294f000) libacl.so.1 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libacl.so.1 (0x00007f9571d29000) libpopt.so.0 =\u0026gt; not found libcrypto.so.1.1 =\u0026gt; /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.1 (0x00007f9571a00000) libc.so.6 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f9571846000) libz.so.1 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libz.so.1 (0x00007f9571d0f000) libdl.so.2 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f9571d0a000) libpthread.so.0 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f9571ce9000) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f9571dd6000) and then it\u0026rsquo;s very easy find the missing RDEPEND that must be fixed in the Macaroni repository:
$\u0026gt; luet q belongs libpopt.so.0 dev-libs/popt-1.16 In this case the library popt is missing on runtime_deps and you need to install it directly:

The whip-catalog is a YAML files catalog with bash/sh commands. If you find something missing or you have some idea about new hooks, please open a PR.
What next? Well, few is changed after the release 23.03 so, the open points are the same but we will push forward with a major priority the documentation. I hope that we will cover a good documentation part for the next release. Stay tuned!
We waiting for you We waiting for you in our Discord Server.
Thanks Many thanks to all Funtoo devs that are the sap of all this and to all people that helps us with testing and donations.

`}),e.add({id:3,href:"/blog/phoenix-23.03/",title:"Macaroni OS Phoenix 23.03 is out!",section:"Blog",content:`Finally, after two months of hard work, the release Phoenix 23.03 is out and is the first Desktop release under the new macaronios.org domain.
In these two months, we had to follow infrastructure issues (broken hard disks) and create the new Macaroni network. This is one of the reasons we have skipped the release of February.
We want to thank again the GARR consortium that is now our primary mirror under our CDN and this will permit in the next weeks to expose again the ISOs download page and our LXD images.
This release doesn\u0026rsquo;t expose extraordinary packages or upgrades but is a big milestone for us because a lot of our work is under the hood and will be better understood by the users in the next months when another big target will be reached: the creation of the Macaroni documentation.
A big milestone The first major target reached is the first big rewrite of the Macaroni PMS tool luet that now:
has a new solver completely rewritten that now respects repositories priorities, it\u0026rsquo;s 100x fast and consumes few memory. The only limit at the moment is that until the luet-build binary will be rewritten the repository metadata will be yet with a big YAML file that must be exploded at least one time when is called the luet repo update command but this will be fixed in the near future. This is been an important result to begin ARM integration
the integration of the new solver has permitted the creation of the mask packages feature. It works in a similar way to Funtoo portage and will be described in detail in the Macaroni documentation in the near future. This is an important result because will permit to supply multiple versions of the same package and using the mask feature to hide a specific version to a target rootfs. You can think of a package like NVIDIA drivers where legacy cards need to have a specific version, or again if a user wants to create their packages and hide the Macaroni version, etc.
the provides support is been reviewed to permit a good means to manage correctly packages that are replaced. The correct way to use provide is to define a specific version in the provides and not a selector. For example:
provides: - category: cat name: foo version: 0.1.0 the install command now doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to upgrade automatically the system; it just tries to resolve the dependencies and the packages selected and install them. This will permit to install of specific packages also when there are upgrades available.
the luet now permits to select of packages only by name. I really love this feature, because permits the reduction of the text written and speeds up the installation and research. For example:
$\u0026gt; luet i app-emulation/lxd-compose becomes:
$\u0026gt; luet i lxd-compose luet repo list command has now a new look and option:
$\u0026gt; luet repo list --urls geaaru-repo-index Geaaru Repository index Revision 4 - 2023-02-25 10:32:39 +0000 UTC Priority 1 - Type http Urls: * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geaaru/repo-index/gh-pages macaroni-commons-dev Macaroni OS Commons Development Repository Revision 131 - 2023-03-08 22:17:57 +0000 UTC Priority 10 - Type http Urls: * https://dev.macaronios.org/macaroni-commons-dev/ macaroni-commons-testing Macaroni OS Commons Testing Repository Priority 20 - Type http Urls: * https://dl.macaronios.org/repos/macaroni-commons-testing/ * https://cdn2.macaronios.org/repos/macaroni-commons-testing/ * https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/repos/macaroni-commons-testing/ the original solvers are no more available and will be dropped from the code when also the luet-build binary will be rewritten.
The upgrades/installs output is now more clear with the cons that for now the download process is not parallel. This fixes the progress bar issues. We are working on following an output similar to portage that will be available in the next release 0.35.0.
We have begun to work on commands that permit configuring subsets but they are to be complete.
it\u0026rsquo;s now available a new command luet query orphans that permits retrieving all packages no more available in the enabled repository.
In general, now you can control with luet every action and package of your system. If there are issues in the new solver you aren\u0026rsquo;t blocked, you can manually fix issues with hidden (and for expert users) commands luet miner that will be described in the documentation.
This is what is been said from an user on testing the new luet binary:
Feels like you took a Ford Fiesta and turned it into a Ferrari
Really, thanks for this comment that will get me more power to go ahead.
A lot of new improvements and features are in our backlog.
An important thing that is not yet available is the possibility to downgrade the packages if I user wants to convert a rootfs updated with a testing repository to a stable repository. But is in our plan to add this feature soon.
ATTENTION: Due to all these changes, my suggestion is to upgrade this time the luet binary manually with a download from the site and the follow what is been described in the new FAQ section of the website.
$\u0026gt; sudo wget -O /usr/bin/luet https://github.com/geaaru/luet/releases/download/v0.34.2-geaaru/luet-v0.34.2-geaaru-Linux-x86_64 $\u0026gt; sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/luet We will improve this operation in the near future.
macaronictl gets power! The luet rewritten is not the only new improvement, the management CLI of Macaroni OS, macaronictl gets more power:
macaronictl env-update is been completely written in Golang following the same Funtoo/Gentoo logic. This permits to have Macaroni OS systems to the need to install the sys-apps/portage package. This migration is not yet completely completed but will be so in the next release.
macaronictl tool has a new etc-update command written in Golang that uses the same /etc/etc-update.conf config and it implements a similar logic to the Portage etc-update command.
macaronictl tool has a new kernel availables command that permit to retrieve all kernel available from the enabled repositories and supply some metadata:
$\u0026gt; macaronictl kernel availables --lts | KERNEL | KERNEL VERSION | PACKAGE VERSION | EOL | LTS | RELEASED | TYPE | |----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|------|------------|---------| | macaroni | 4.14.305 | 4.14.305 | Jan, 2024 | true | 2017-11-12 | vanilla | | macaroni | 5.10.168 | 5.10.168 | Dec, 2026 | true | 2020-12-13 | vanilla | | macaroni | 5.15.94 | 5.15.94 | Oct, 2026 | true | 2021-10-31 | vanilla | | macaroni | 5.4.231 | 5.4.231 | Dec, 2025 | true | 2019-11-24 | vanilla | | macaroni | 6.1.12 | 6.1.12 | Dec, 2026 | true | 2022-12-11 | vanilla | This will help with the feature that will be available in the next future to switch between kernels.
Funtoo integration (experimental) In the middle of all the new implementations we have released a new release of the luet-portage-converter tool that is used normally to generate automatically updates from our luet specs.
I hope that this will be a lovely experience for the Funtoo users.
I will leave users with a bit of suspense until I will write the documentation in the next weeks but the new luet-portage-converter sync command will permits:
convert a Funtoo system to a Macaroni OS and get updates from Macaroni or restore the broken system.
sync with the Macaroni PMS the packages installed with emerge to the luet database and/or sync packages previously installed with luet and then upgraded with emerge.
Obviously, to use these features is needed a Macaroni OS with subsets portage and devel enabled.
ATTENTION: This new command is pretty experimental and must be used carefour.
Domain migration again I\u0026rsquo;m sorry but after the integration of the Consortium GARR I reviewed the stable domains with a CDN chain. I added in the FAQ section of the website some tips about easily upgrading the repositories. I hope that things will be more stable now but using free services has some cons.
What\u0026rsquo;s new This new release has some interesting updates:
LXD 5.11 and LXC 5.0.2
Libreoffice 7.5.0.3
Firefox 1.109.0.1
Brave 1.48.158
Grafana 9.3.6 and Prometheus 2.42.0
Blender 3.4.1
ZFS 2.1.9
KDE Framework 5.85.5 and KDE Plasma 5.22.5
Openshot video editing tool updated to release 2.6.1
Cinelerra is been dropped. The website has tons of forks without a tag and it seems hard to maintain.
Grub 2.04 with patch related to the use of new e2fsprogs v.1.47.0. See debian issue.
Open VMtools 12.1.5
All kernels modules are been renamed following the naming convention: kernel-\u0026lt;kernel-branch\u0026gt; as category. This will help searching and macaronictl integration. Always related to the kernel, the string LTS is been removed from kernel packages. The LTS information is now available over the package annotations.
See the release page for the detail of all updates.
What next? Hereinafter, our hot points for the next releases:
Drop support to Python 2.7 from Phoenix and leave Python 3.7 only. We will upgrade to Python 3.9 later.
Continue to work begun on writing documentation and FAQ for users.
Begin the rewrite of luet-build binary and improve look\u0026amp;feel of the luet output.
Add the new ISOs webpage and prepare the release of the ISO 23.03. We need to wait for the sync of the GARR mirror and the propagation.
Add new features to luet-portage-converter to manage multiple versions of the same package.
Add new features to macaronictl tool
Add Macaroni OS LXD images to images.linuxcontainers.org.

What next? Hereinafter, our hot points for the near future:
We working to complete the review of the luet installer and his algorithms to reduce the memory usage, rewrite the solver and introduce the packages mask concept. This will permit us to begin on working a Macaroni release for ARM (Banana PI, Raspberry).
The terragon release will drop the support to Python 3.7 to leave active only Python 3.9.
Create a full and clear documentation of all Macaroni features.
When the first two points will be reached will start the integration of macaroni-ffs project related to the Funtoo FFS technology and permit users to have easy the toolchains for compilation
A lot of things are in our plan, stay tuned!
Additional thanks On setup of the new infrastructure, I want to thank the all people who helped me in setting up the Cloudflare services in about two days. Really, thanks.

Using an LXD container # The Funtoo \u0026amp; Macaroni teams supply their LXD images over a Simplestreams Server. To configure the LXD remote just run this command:
$\u0026gt; lxc remote add macaroni https://macaronios.mirror.garr.it/images/lxd-images --protocol simplestreams --public and then check the available images:
$\u0026gt; lxc image list macaroni: Knows Issues # The current status of the Macaroni OS is related to its PMS that is under heavy development and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet support the requirements needed for a Desktop environment very well and is unstable.
The main issue is that the current upgrade process executes an uninstall of all packages to upgrade before beginning the installation of the new packages and without checking if there are changes. This may sometimes generate issues with X.
So, for the moment, we suggest that you upgrade a Desktop environment from terminal (just switch with CTRL+ALT+F1).
If used in a Container environment instead, that could be a valid and stable solution. In a container, the upgrade process is less important because, usually, the container is dropped and recreated from a new image. In this condition you could create a very optimized container thanks to the subsets feature available in the fork release of luet.
Macaroni doesn\u0026rsquo;t use the Funtoo ebuild in the installation phase, this means that the post-install scripts must be managed from the luet finalizer. In particular, the whip tool has been created to help in this job, and the whip-catalog to store all the hooks to call. For any Desktop environment, the post-install hooks could be configured to run correctly in all packages.
The whip tool can be run and the catalog can be displayed with this command:
$\u0026gt; whip list --table +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | FILE | NAME | DESCRIPTION | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | gtk | mime_update_db | Update mime cache. | | gtk | gtk_update_icons | Update Gnome icons cache. | | gtk | glib_update_schemas | Update Glib Schemas. | | texlive | texlive_postinst | Setup texlive files. | | | | | | texlive | texlive_rebuild_fmt | Rebuild TeX formats. | | | | | | dbus | dbus_gen_machineid | Setup /etc/machine-id. | | eudev | eudev_setup | Validate Eudev setup. | | | | | | fonts | create_scale | Create fonts.scale file, used by the old server-side fonts subsystem. | | fonts | create_fonts_dir | Create fonts.dir file, used by the old server-side fonts subsystem. | | | | | | fonts | setup_all_fonts | Setup fonts. | | | | | | openrc | openrc_setup | Setup core OpenRC services. | | | | | | perl | postinst | Setup perl binaries links. | | | | | | polkit | polkit_setup | Setup env for polkitd. | | | | | | eclass_db | db_cleanup | Clean libdb* links and includes. | | | | | | eclass_db | db_fix_so | Fix links of /usr/include/db.h and .so | | | | | | elogind | elogind_setup | Check elogind setup. | | | | | | gdb | setup | Setup gdm files. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ A hook is callable with the hook subcommand:

You know, the world is buggy, it\u0026rsquo;s better to have a way to check and resolve the problems fast.
In the middle of the story, Macaroni OS wants to be an optimized distro for LXD containers, docker and singularity.
So, in summary, these are the core targets of the Macaroni OS Linux:
Container Optimized Through the subsets feature of the Luet tool will make it easy to have a thin rootfs and customize the files installed from a package and run CD/CI tasks and/or pipeline fast. Automation Share a way to build packages without a giant infrastructure but with the pros of CD/CI. Macaroni developer teams share how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to do this through lxd-compose or with a more scalable solution through Mottainai Server. Revolution Hotspot To be a good start point for revolutions within the Linux OS space with the synergy of the Funtoo Team. Macaroni Releases # Following the core targets just described in Macaroni there are different releases:
Release Codename Funtoo Release Description Phoenix 1.4-prime The core release based on OpenRC/SysVinit for Server and Desktop Eagle 1.4-prime + patches A Funtoo SystemD release. The idea is to use it only for Server target and as experimental base rootfs where we will develop an alternative tool that will replace SystemD probably written in Golang but that will be compatible with part of SystemD files. In this moment, this release has only Container based targets and Server services. Terragon next The next release based on OpenRC/SysVinit Funtoo system with Container oriented use flags. Macaroni OS Phoenix # The Phoenix release is the first release created and the only release at the moment for the Desktop. The codename phoenix is related to the immortal bird associated with Greek mythology that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor. This is the reason I choose this name: to describe a new beginning and to remember us that also when others try to stop a dream, with the commitment it\u0026rsquo;s possible reborn and goes ahead.
In phoenix it\u0026rsquo;s used the OpenRC as an init system, it\u0026rsquo;s based on Funtoo 1.4-prime and so:
* GCC 9.2.0 * Glibc 2.33 * Python 3.7 (2.7 is available but will be dropped in the near future) * LLVM 11 The desktop environments available in this release are:
Desktop Environment Version Status ISO Available Gnome 3.36 stable yes XFCE 4.16 stable yes Enlightenment 0.25.4 experimental no KDE 5.22 experimental no As the first release a lot of things could be improved but it\u0026rsquo;s also true that the Desktop is something complex that requires a lot of effort and computing. We will work to clean up things and speed up the building phase that now it\u0026rsquo;s very expensive, in particular for the build of the funtoo-base seed based on Gnome Funtoo stage3.
Macaroni OS Eagle # The Eagle release is born to be used in container, it\u0026rsquo;s based on Funtoo 1.4-prime with patches to integrate SystemD as an init system.
Without the need to support the Desktop, the release is been compiled with server-oriented and X-less use flags. This permits to have core packages fewer dependencies and more optimized for containers.
Like phoenix also eagle is based on Funtoo 1.4-prime and so:
* GCC 9.2.0 * Glibc 2.33 * Python 3.7 (2.7 is available but will be dropped in the near future) * LLVM 11 Macaroni OS Terragon # The Terragon release is born to be used in container and it\u0026rsquo;s based on Funtoo Next that is the more innovative release of Funtoo.
Like for eagle release the terragon release is been compiled with server-oriented and X-less use flags.
Based on Funtoo Next some core packages are:
* GCC 11.3.0 * Glibc 2.33 * Python 3.9 `})})()
