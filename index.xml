      <description>After receiving the first notifications we caught an issue in our last ISOs related to the split of the Grub package done to divide the grub-emu binary. It&amp;rsquo;s been removed for error the Grub&amp;rsquo;s patches related to ext4 1.47.0 and of Macaroni initramfs naming.
Without the patch the default installation fails on setup grub because it&amp;rsquo;s used ext4 and an unknown filesystem error is generated by grub.
The new ISOs will be available in two days.</description>

      <description>While we have worked on preparing the new ISOs for the release 23.03 we have figured out that was better to bump a new release with the changes of the Calamares plugin to migrate our ISOs to kernel 6.1. In particular, the ISOs for Desktops have now the kernel 6.1.18 with built-in integration with new Realtek wifi cards. Unluckily not yet the cards 8852b e 8852be that will be available on branch 6.</description>

      <description>Finally, after two months of hard work, the release Phoenix 23.03 is out and is the first Desktop release under the new macaronios.org domain.
In these two months, we had to follow infrastructure issues (broken hard disks) and create the new Macaroni network. This is one of the reasons we have skipped the release of February.
We want to thank again the GARR consortium that is now our primary mirror under our CDN and this will permit in the next weeks to expose again the ISOs download page and our LXD images.</description>

      <description>After 1 year of incubation under the Funtoo Foundation, the Macaroni OS has now its domain macaronios.org and its infrastructure. Really, thanks to the Funtoo Foundation and Daniel Robbins for its support that helped to Macaroni OS to be here today.
From the infrastructure aspect nothing is changed, all compilation tasks are executed over MottainaiCI cluster but with less resource power for now.
We hope that the community will help us to maintain the infrastructure costs with donations over our Github Sponsor or with VMs donations for compilation.</description>

      <description>Getting Started # Install Macaroni ISO # Choice the right ISO for your requirements from our Download page.
1.Validate downloaded ISO # After the you have downloaded the ISOs file, I suggest to verify the quality of the download throw our SHA256 hash:
$ sha256sum Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso 8637d8c6ba72f8694aabd631f038473acaadd0fbb8fc9fa7cec7bb0d495f1f54 Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso $ cat Macaroni-Funtoo-Phoenix-Gnome-23.03.02.iso.sha256 8637d8c6ba72f8694aabd631f038473acaadd0fbb8fc9fa7cec7bb0d495f1f54 If the download is correct the hash will be the same.
Until the issue #7 will be fixed you need to compare the sha256 manually.</description>

Hereinafter, a table with the different technologies and the availability in the Macaroni releases.

      <description>I write this article because I think that it&amp;rsquo;s needed to understand the story to improve things and instead follow the original choices when they make sense.
The Origins # After a lot of years working with opensource packages, I can for sure to said that there are so many possibilities to configure our systems that it isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient one life to test all combinations.
But the power to choose is one of the more powerful things that the open-source world gift and the same packages often are created with the possibility to compile and build them in different ways.</description>
